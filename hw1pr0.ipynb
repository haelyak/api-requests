    "A) I found the node \"I think there is a story here\" really interesting because I had never thought about the distinct difference between exploring the data for exploration's sake and actively looking for something in the data. But I think this makes sense because if you are exploring for exploration's sake, you are often keeping the findings to yourself, whereas if you are looking for a story, you probably hope to publicize your findings. The people that this node is probably targeted towards are journalists hoping to uncover something revolutionary (most likely some sort of scandal), which makes it hard for me to agree or disagree with this decision node. I know that there are certain guidelines that journalists must follow, but I also know that some things are never revealed to the public until someone digs in some slightly questionable manner. So should we allow some unethical journalism practices if they reveal scandal that would otherwise remain under wraps? It feels like the answer is no, but then if journalism is not ruled by ethics won't it descend into chaos?\n",
